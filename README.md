# ai-voice-assistant

I hooked up you.com's youchat into speech to text and text to speech services, to create an AI voice assistant. I'm using this alongside vb-cable and vmagicmirror to create an anime character chatbot. The code supports both text and voice input, configuring voice, wake word, and prompt context, and of course vb-cable support. See '-h' for launch parameters.
